# Rock-Paper-Scissors
## Codecademy JavaScript Project

### Aim: 
To build a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors in JavaScript

### Project Brief:
‘Rock paper scissors is a classic two player game. Each player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors. The items are compared, and whichever player chooses the more powerful item wins.
The possible outcomes are:
* Rock destroys scissors.
* Scissors cut paper.
*	Paper covers rock.
*	If there’s a tie, then the game ends in a draw.’

### How it Works:
The code breaks the game into four parts. 
* Get the user’s choice.
* Get the computer’s choice.
* Compare the two choices and determine a winner.
* Start the program and display the results.
* The code also includes a secret cheat code. When they type in ‘bomb’, the user will win every time.
